Description of our evidence 2

In this folder named evident2_defenitive, the corresponding database was created to test our web application, for this we used models and migrations for our database.

To fill our database we used seeders and factories respectively to feed our tables so that our web application could simulate data entry. In the same way, we used a controller to create the view of one of the basic screens of our application and in it show information about one of our database tables.

On the other hand, the other basic views of our design were attached for the final views that our web application would have.
